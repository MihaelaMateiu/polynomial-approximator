# Polynomial Approximator
This code generates a polynomial approximator with configurable degree that is useful for a "Fitting an unknown function" project

Overview of the above mentioned project: 

   There is given a data set of input-output pairs, where the outputs are generated by an unknown function f and we have to develop a model for this function using a polynomial approximator. Also a second data set generated using the same function is provided for validating the developed model.
   
   Once the approximator was programmed, we choose the degree such that g(x) best matches f(x) on the identification dataset, then we find the optimal parameter vector theta using linear regression and next we do the validation part to check the performance on the validation dataset. (MATLAB implementation)
